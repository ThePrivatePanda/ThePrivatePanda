Heyo! Thanks for coming here and boosting me ego, appreciate it üëç <br><br>
I am, koala. Simply. <br>
I spend my time studying and chasing various aspects of life which catch my eye, such as crypto, coding and cycling (CCC hehe). <br>
I have a special interest in ~~abusing~~ testing various sytems, with a want to get into ethical hacking.<br><br>

I've just completed a few projects, lookin to complete a few more! <br>
Anyways, have a look at [my site](https://thekoalaco.in) and help me improve it! <br>

I am always open to new ideas and contributions, to make the world a better place, with a special interest in automation and IoT.
