Hey! Just yo average 15 y/o good-for-nothing neighbour! <br>
Previously known as koala, I am now (evidently I hope) The Private Panda, owner of [PrivatePandaCO](https://github.com/PrivatePandaCO). <br><br>
I've worked on various projects, most of shitcode is open source and now I focus on more advanced closed source projects through my CO. <br>
